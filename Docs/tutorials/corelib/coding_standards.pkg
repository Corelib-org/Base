			It helps if the standard annoys everyone in some way so everyone
			feels they are on the same playing field. 
			The proposal here has evolved over many projects, many companies, 
			and literally a total of many weeks spent arguing. 
			It is no particular person's style and is certainly open to local amendments.

			Non-documentation comments are strongly encouraged.
			A general rule of thumb is that if you look at a section of code and think 
			"Wow, I don't want to try and describe that", 
			you need to comment it before you forget how it works.

				<para>
					The placement of periods in the short and long descriptions is important to the PHPdoc parser.
					The first period always ends the short description. 
					All future periods are part of the long description, ending with a blank comment line. 
					The long comment is optional.

			The use of &lt;?php ?> to delimit PHP code is required. Using &lt;? ?> is not valid. 
			This is the most portable way to include PHP code on differing operating systems 
			and webserver setups. Also, XML parsers are confused by the shorthand syntax.
